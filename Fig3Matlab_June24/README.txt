# Readme for Fig3Matlab_June24 

The necessary Matlab code to make a figure is in the /Code directory.

To run this you need to first execute the script "doGEBMsimulationbatchv2".

This places data in a ../Data subdirectory relative to the code.

Then you need to execute the script "doAnalyseOutputEnsemblev2".
